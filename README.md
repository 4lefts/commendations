# Commendations
A web app using firebase and jquery to allow teachers to post commendation certificates to a database for printing and giving out in assembly. __VERY WIP__.

## To Do:
* css - jquery animations when adding and removing, spinner while loading?
* use "get data slowly setInterval()" for testing?
* proper error handling
* set up subdomain (commendations.decoyschool.co.uk)
* look into firebase hosting
* add admin uuids
* filter out non-decoy school staff emails
